Taylor Alexander's Eagle Library
===========================

This is my Eagle library for parts I use. Use however you want. Some of it is snagged from Sparkfun's library, lots of it is original, and occasionally some of it is taken from other libraries. If I snagged your part and failed to credit you or published it improperly, please let me know.

Feel free to fork this library and make changes, print it out and sell it on the street, 3D print an erotic physical manifestation of it, or generally do whatever other crazy business you like to do with Eagle libraries. Specifically, i'll give this the Apache license. Though it does make me happy to know when I help others, so if I help you, it never hurts to tell me.
